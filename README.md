# Ansible Exam notes

The exam objectives clearly stated that you will be using ansible 2.3. This means some commands in 2.4 and above will not be available in 2.3. Here they are:

## include_tasks

`include_tasks` does not exists in 2.3. Use `include` statement instead

## vault-id

vault-id is not available as a parameter to use. For now, rely on --ask-vault-pass instead.

# Tips

Most of the documentation can be looked up with `ansible-doc -l`. Since it takes a very long time to pull up, you can pipe the list of modules to file before writing any code. This will save time, as you only need to page through or grep in a text file instead of waiting until `ansible-doc -l` loads.  For example, if you need to look up a mysql_user module, you can do this:

```
stardust:~ rilindo$ ansible-doc -l > /tmp/ansible.txt
stardust:~ rilindo$ grep mysql_user /tmp/ansible.txt 
mysql_user                         Adds or removes a user from a MySQL database.                                                   
proxysql_mysql_users               Adds or removes mysql users from proxysql admin interface.                                      
stardust:~ rilindo$ ansible-doc mysql_user
```
